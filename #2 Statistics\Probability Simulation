#Couldn't find the probability of something the easy way, so I just found it the hard way.
#Kinda neat that I'm actually applying what I've learnt from statistics to do this simulation.
#Although,I don't add any comments and so the code looks like a mess. Plus, it is super unoptimized.
#I believe this was created half a year ago.
